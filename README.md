# Delete duplicate files

Forked from: https://github.com/matthewrenze/rename-images
Not used for the same purpose but I used it as the base 

Usage: python.exe Rename.py input-folder
  - input-folder = the directory containing the image files to be renamed

Example: python Deletion.py C:\Photos

Behavior:  
 - Given a filed named "foobar.jpg" and "foobar (1).jpg"   
 - Delete "foobar (1).jpg"

Notes:
  - For safety, please make a backup before running this script
